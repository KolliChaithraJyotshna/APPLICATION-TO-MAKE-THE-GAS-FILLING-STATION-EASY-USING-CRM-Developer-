PROJECT OVERVIEW: 

As a developer, I worked on designing and implementing a Salesforce-based CRM application specifically tailored for gas filling station operations. The main objective of this project was to streamline the process of managing customer interactions, scheduling gas refills, and tracking service and delivery activities, all within a centralized, cloud-based system. Traditionally, these stations relied heavily on manual processes, leading to inefficiencies, missed refill schedules, and limited visibility into customer data. This CRM solution was built to address those challenges and enhance both operational efficiency and customer satisfaction. The application includes several core features such as customer registration and profile management, gas refill booking, automated service reminders, and delivery tracking. It also integrates SMS and email notifications to keep customers informed. An intuitive dashboard allows station managers to monitor orders and access real-time data. Built using Salesforce tools like custom objects and flows, the system reduced manual tasks, improved communication, and delivered a scalable solution tailored to the gas filling industry.


OBJECTIVES:

The core objective of this project was to develop a Salesforce-based CRM application designed to simplify significantly and automate key operations for gas filling stations. This smart, user-friendly system aims to centralize crucial processes often hampered by manual methods, such as managing customer information, refill schedules, and deliveries. By bringing these into one integrated platform, the CRM will enhance customer experiences through improved management and automated communications (SMS/email notifications), fostering greater loyalty and satisfaction. Concurrently, it will optimize store operations by streamlining the gas filling process, thereby reducing manual errors, improving service speed, and providing store managers with real-time dashboards for clear oversight. Ultimately, this application seeks to improve overall efficiency across the gas filling industry by enabling better resource allocation and creating a more seamless, organized, and customer-friendly experience for both staff and patrons.

Design Data Model and Security Model
Data Model for Gas Filling Station CRM

The data model supports the operational needs of a gas filling station, ensuring structured data storage and relational integrity across standard and custom Salesforce objects.

Objects :
Object Name
Purpose
Key Fields
Relationships
Supplier
Stores supplier company information
Name, Contact Information, Supply Type, Rating
Lookup to Fuel Details
Fuel Details
Catalogs fuel types and properties
Fuel Type, Cost/liter, Available Quantity
Master-detail with Gas Station
Gas Station
Defines each station’s location and capacity
Station Name, Address, Total Tanks
Lookup to Fuel Details, Bookings

 Security Model
The security model in Salesforce determines which users can see, create, edit, or delete records and fields within the application. This ensures data integrity, privacy, and adherence to operational roles.

Objective: To implement a robust security framework that grants appropriate access levels based on user roles and responsibilities within the gas filling station, leveraging Salesforce's declarative security features.

Key Security Components and Their Application:

Org-Wide Defaults (OWD):
Customer / Account / Contact:Private. This ensures that users can only see records they own or are explicitly granted access to, protecting customer data by default.
Vehicle:Private. Similar to customers, vehicle data should be restricted to relevant users.


Refill Request:Private. Each request should be primarily visible to the staff member handling it and their managers.
Delivery:Private. Delivery records visible only to relevant delivery personnel and their managers.
Gas Station Product:Public Read Only. Product information (fuel types, prices) should generally be visible to all staff, but editable only by specific roles.

Role Hierarchy:
CEO/Owner (Top Role): Full visibility to all data.
Gas Station Manager: Can see all records owned by staff at their station.
Gas Station Staff: Can see/manage their own records and potentially records related to customers they are serving.
Delivery Driver: Can see delivery records assigned to them and potentially relevant customer/vehicle details for those deliveries.
Customer (Community/Experience Cloud User): Limited access, primarily to their own requests, vehicle information, and loyalty data.

Profiles:
System Administrator Profile: Full access (CRUD) to all objects and fields.
Gas Station Manager Profile:
Read, Create, Edit, Delete (CRUD) permissions on Refill Request, Customer, Vehicle, Delivery, Gas Station Product.
View All and Modify All on objects relevant to their station.
Gas Station Staff Profile:
Read, Create, Edit on Refill Request, Customer, Vehicle. (Delete often restricted).
Read Only on Delivery, Gas Station Product.
Field-Level Security (FLS) to hide sensitive fields like payment details from general staff.
Delivery Driver Profile:
Read, Edit on Delivery records assigned to them.
Read Only on Customer and Vehicle records related to their deliveries.
Customer Community User Profile:
Read, Create, Edit on their ownCustomer, Vehicle, Refill Request records.
No access to other customers' data or internal operational objects.



Permission Sets:
"Product Price Updater" Permission Set: Granted to specific managers or administrators to allow Edit access on Current Price per Liter field on Gas Station Product, overriding default profile restrictions.
"Loyalty Program Manager" Permission Set: Grants specific users access to manage loyalty points or special customer segments.

Sharing Rules:
Criteria-Based Sharing Rule: Share all Refill Request records where "Status" is 'New' or 'Scheduled' with "Gas Station Staff" public group (or roles and subordinates), so anyone can pick up a new request.
Owner-Based Sharing Rule: Automatically share Customer and Vehicle records owned by any "Gas Station Staff" role with the "Gas Station Manager" role.

Field-Level Security (FLS):
Restrict the visibility and editability of sensitive fields like Total Amount, Payment Method, Loyalty ID, In Stock Quantity to only authorized profiles (e.g., Gas Station Manager, System Administrator).
		

Phase - 2: Salesforce Development - Backend & Configuration

This phase of the project focused on building the core functionality of the CRM on the Salesforce platform. It involved setting up the development environment, configuring custom objects and fields, and implementing automation and Apex code to support the business processes.

Setup Environment & DevOps Workflow
The development environment was a Salesforce Sandbox. The DevOps workflow was kept simple for this project, with all development work being done directly in the sandbox. Changes were tracked and deployed to the production environment using Change Sets. This method was chosen for its ease of use and suitability for a project of this scale. 

For future development, a more robust DevOps solution involving version control (like Git) and an automated deployment tool (like Salesforce DX) would be considered like as follows

Sandbox/Developer Org Setup:
A Salesforce Developer Org was configured for building and testing the application. 
App Creation: 
Created a Lightning App named “GAS STATION”, which included all custom object tabs (Supplier, Gas Station, Buyer, Fuel Details). 
	
User & Role Configuration: 
Set up three profiles: Manager, Sales Executive, and Sales Person. Implemented 
Role Hierarchy: 
○ Manager → Sales Executive → Sales Person. 

Permission Set (P1) created to grant additional access (e.g., Read & Create on Fuel Details). 

OWD & Sharing Settings: 
Organization-Wide Defaults were configured: Gas Station & Supplier objects are set to Public Read-Only.

Folder sharing (e.g., Fuel Estimation Folder) was configured with role based access.

Customization of Objects, Fields, and Automation
This section details the declarative configurations made to the Salesforce org to build the application's backend.
Custom Objects: The project's data model was built using the following custom objects:
Supplier: Stores supplier information.
Gas Station: Represents the gas station itself.
Buyer: Stores customer information.
Fuel Details: A junction object with two Master-Detail relationships, linking Supplier and Gas Station objects to track fuel transactions.
Field Customization: A variety of custom fields were created on the objects to capture all necessary business data.
Number Field: Added to the Fuel Details object to track quantities.
Roll-up Summary Fields: Created on the Supplier and Gas Station objects to aggregate data from their related Fuel Details records.
Formula Fields:
A formula field on the Gas Station object dynamically calculates values based on other fields.

A cross-object formula field on the Buyer object pulls data from the related Gas Station record.
Picklist Field: Added to the Buyer object to provide a predefined list of options.
      As follows:
 Created lookup relationships between Fuel Details → Supplier and Gas Station. 
 Added Roll-Up Summary fields to calculate: Total fuel supplied, Fuel available at the gas station. 
Created Formula fields (e.g., Customer Name, Amount Paid). Picklist fields like Vehicle Type and Mode of Payment were configured.
Validation Rules: A validation rule was created on the Buyer object to ensure the phone number is entered in a specific format, improving data quality.

Objects and their respective Fields
Automation (Flows, Workflow Rules, Approval Processes) : Automation was a key part of the project, using various Salesforce tools to streamline business processes.
Record-Triggered Flow: A flow was created to automate a key business process. For instance, when a new Fuel Details record is created, the flow automatically updates the remaining inventory on the Gas Station object.
Approval Process: While not explicitly mentioned in the project details, a common business requirement for this type of application would be an approval process for large-scale credit sales or new supplier onboarding. This would route records to a manager for approval before they can be processed.
	As follows :
A Record-Triggered Flow was created on the Buyer object: 
Triggered on record creation or update. 
Sends a Thank You Email to customers including details like fuel quantity, vehicle type, and amount paid. 

Workflow Rules & Process Builder: 
Auto-updates inventory or triggers approval processes when thresholds are reached. 
Reports & Dashboards: 
Reports (e.g., “Amount Range”) and Dashboard components were built to visualize fuel consumption and payments.

Apex Classes, Triggers, and Asynchronous Apex
For complex business logic that could not be achieved with declarative tools, Apex was used.
Apex Handler: An Apex handler class was developed to contain all the complex business logic, such as custom calculations or data manipulation.
Where to add details: This is where you would include the full code for your Apex class, along with comments explaining its purpose and functionality. For example, if your handler calculates the total revenue from a specific fuel type based on complex criteria, you would include that code here.


Apex Triggers: A trigger was implemented to execute the logic in the Apex handler. The trigger is an essential component that ensures the Apex code runs automatically when a specific database event occurs, such as a record being inserted or updated. For example, a trigger on the Fuel Details object could call the Apex handler to automatically update the Gas Station roll-up summary fields in real-time.

Before Delete Trigger: On Fuel Details to call beforeDeleteInfo(). 
Before Insert Trigger: On Gas Station to validate fuel price using beforeDeleteGas().
Where to add details: You should include the code for your trigger and explain the database events that cause it to fire.
Asynchronous Apex Classes: For long-running or resource-intensive processes, asynchronous Apex (such as future methods or batch Apex) would be implemented. This prevents the application from hitting governor limits and ensures a smooth user experience. For this project, a future method could be used to send an email notification to a supplier when a large order is placed, while a batch Apex class could be used to clean up old records or perform nightly calculations.
Where to add details: If you developed any asynchronous Apex, you would include the code for those classes and explain the specific use case they address.

Phase 3: UI/UX Development & Customization
The UI/UX development phase focused on making the GAS STATION CRM  application visually structured, user-friendly, and efficient for day-to-day operations. This  involved customizing the Lightning experience, page layouts, and dashboards to deliver an  intuitive interface for all user profiles. 
Lightning App setup through App Manager:
 A custom Lightning App named "Gas Station Manager" was created to provide a unified user experience for the station staff.
A Lightning App named “GAS STATION” was created through the App  Manager.
Key features:  Custom Tabs: Supplier, Gas Station, Buyer, and Fuel Details. 
App Branding: Added a custom color and icon to reflect the Gas  Station theme.  Optimized for Salesforce Lightning Experience for a modern UI.
Added navigation tabs for key objects:  Supplier , Gas Station,  Buyer,  Fuel Details. 

Page Layouts, Dynamic Forms: Page layouts were customized for the Customer and Transaction objects to display the most important information prominently. Dynamic forms were used to show or hide fields based on user input, simplifying the data entry process.
User Management: User profiles were created for "Station Attendant" and "Station Manager" to control access to objects, fields, and app functionality.

Reports and Dashboards: Reports were created to track daily sales, fuel consumption, and customer transactions. A dashboard was developed to provide a visual summary of key performance indicators for the station manager.
Lightning Pages: A custom Lightning record page was designed for the Customer object to include related lists and a highlights panel, providing a 360-degree view of each customer.
Phase 4: Data Migration, Testing & Security
This phase of the project was critical for ensuring the CRM's reliability, data integrity, and security. It included the processes for loading data into the system, configuring security settings, and rigorously testing all features
Data loading process: The Data Import Wizard was used to load initial customer data and fuel inventory records into the system.
For this project, the initial data loading was performed using the Data Import Wizard. This tool was used to import flat files containing existing records for Suppliers and Buyers into their respective custom objects. While the Data Import Wizard is suitable for a small number of records, for a large-scale data migration, a more robust tool like Data Loader would be used. The data was meticulously prepared and mapped to the correct fields in Salesforce before the import to ensure accuracy.
Field History Tracking, Duplicate Rules, Matching Rules: Field history tracking was enabled on key fields of the Customer and Fuel Inventory objects to monitor changes. Duplicate rules and matching rules were implemented to prevent the creation of duplicate customer records.
Field History Tracking: This was enabled on key fields of the Buyer and Gas Station objects. It provides an audit trail of changes made to these fields, including the old and new values, the user who made the change, and the timestamp.
Duplicate Rules: A duplicate rule was created for the Buyer object. This rule alerts users when they are about to create a record that is a duplicate of an existing one.


Matching Rules: A matching rule was created in conjunction with the duplicate rule to define what constitutes a duplicate. For example, a matching rule for the Buyer object might be based on a combination of the buyer's name and phone number.
Profiles, Roles and Role Hierarchy, Permission Sets, and Sharing Rules
A robust security model was established to control access to the application's data.
Profiles: Custom profiles were created for Manager, Sales Executive, and Sales Person to define their baseline permissions.
Roles and Role Hierarchy: A role hierarchy was set up with Manager at the top. The Sales Executive and Sales Person roles were placed below, enabling the Manager to view all data owned by their subordinates.
Permission Sets: Permission sets were used to grant additional permissions to specific users or groups without altering their profiles, providing flexibility.
Sharing Rules: To handle exceptions to the organization-wide defaults, sharing rules were created. For example, a sharing rule could be set up to grant a specific sales person read-only access to a set of records owned by another sales person.
Creation of Test Classes
Apex test classes were written for the Apex Handler to ensure all code works as expected. The test classes were designed to achieve at least 75% code coverage, which is a mandatory requirement for deploying Apex code to a production environment.

Phase 5: Deployment, Documentation & Maintenance
This phase concludes the project lifecycle by outlining the final steps of deploying the application to the production environment, documenting the system, and planning for its long-term maintenance.
Deployment strategy: Change sets were used to deploy the developed components from the sandbox to the production environment. The chosen deployment strategy for this project was Change Sets. This method was selected for its simplicity and built-in Salesforce functionality, which makes it ideal for a project of this size. The process involved creating an outbound change set in the development sandbox, adding all the necessary components (custom objects, fields, flows, Apex classes, etc.), and then deploying it to the production environment.A pre-deployment checklist was used to ensure all components and dependencies were included, minimizing the risk of deployment errors. For future, more complex projects, a version control system like Git and a continuous integration/continuous deployment (CI/CD) tool would be recommended to automate the process and manage code changes more effectively.
System Maintenance and Monitoring:
The system will be maintained and monitored to ensure its continued performance, reliability, and security.
Regular Monitoring: The Debug Logs will be periodically reviewed to identify any errors or performance issues.
Performance Analysis: Salesforce's built-in tools like the Performance Analysis dashboard will be used to monitor the application's overall health and identify any bottlenecks.
User Feedback: A system for collecting and prioritizing user feedback will be implemented to identify opportunities for improvement and future enhancements.
Scheduled Updates: Regular maintenance windows will be scheduled to apply Salesforce updates, patch bugs, and deploy new features.

Troubleshooting approach: 
A systematic troubleshooting approach has been documented to assist administrators in resolving issues.
Error Logs: The first step in any troubleshooting process is to check the Apex Jobs and Debug Logs for specific error messages.
User Permissions: Verify that the user experiencing the issue has the correct profile, permission sets, and sharing rules configured.
Data Integrity: Check for data inconsistencies or duplicate records that might be causing a flow or trigger to fail.
Replication: Attempt to replicate the issue in a sandbox environment to diagnose the root cause without affecting the production system.
